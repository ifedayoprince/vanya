# How It Works

VanyaJS is divided into 2 parts:
- The CLI
- The Registry
 
<Callout type="info">
  The NPM installation of Vanya installs just the CLI.
</Callout>


## Adding a Component

```sh copy
vanya add fade-card
```

Vanya checks its cache if the component is already downloaded.
If not, it fetches the component from its remote registry and caches it.

The component is then moved from the cache to your project's directory.
