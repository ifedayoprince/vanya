# Introduction

## Why Vanya?

The bitter truth is that users are transitioning from expecting websites that **"just work"**, they connect better when they feel part of the process.<br/><br/>
They need sites that don't just **sell**, but **tell**; Sites that bring them along the journey and tell a story in a way they can relate.

## What is VanyaJS?

VanyaJS is a React component registry built from the ground-up to empower your story.<br/>
Every component has been crafted with deep care to ensure your users get an uninterrupted understanding of your story.
